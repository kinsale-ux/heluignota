<h1> # No Name </h1>
<h2> Inspired by Aryana Rose's "A Love Not Meant For Me" & Jaques Lacan </h2>
    <p> Life is so precious, we should not sacrifice ourselves in such a way that we test the depth of our desires by drowning ourselves inside of it. We should not blindingly wander into the wilderness of love, nor speak our truths to one another for our words would be lost to the ether.
We should live with intention and a selfless compassion for those who enter our lives.
We should embrace life as we know it— life as we have chosen our sacrifices, otherwise our cercumstances would have it decided for us. We only have one life and it is defined to us as it is given. In pieces, present one moment and past in another, future never to be achieved but “an endless pursuit of sensation yielding nothing of permanence.”  </p>
